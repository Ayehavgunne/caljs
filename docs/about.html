				<h1>Why Era.js - Tales of woe</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>I needed a date picker. One that would allow me to select arbitrary dates and date ranges. I have had difficulty finding something that could do both. I did find a ton of date pickers that could select a range using two clicks on two dates creating a continuous range. I didn't want that because I frequently want to exclude the weekends from my selections. I did find some date pickers that allowed me to select arbitrary dates... if I clicked each one at a time.</p>
				<p>Then I found the YUI date picker which made me happy sad. I was happad or sappy. Sappy sounds better.</p>
				<p>So I was sappy because I found a library that gave me what I wanted plus a whole lot more that I didn't need. I could select individual days with a single click. I could select multiple arbitrary days with ctrl-click. I could select ranges with shift-click. It worked the way all multi-selection does everywhere else in computing. Why has this been so hard to find for HTML/JavaScript based date pickers?!</p>
				<p>Anyway, YUI was more than I really needed. I just wanted the date picker but it came with a whole suite of tools to creating UI's of cource. I didn't know how to pull out just the picker from the rest of the library. I don't think there was a custom build tool for selecting individual components like what JQuery UI has.</p>
				<p>I have been using YUI for a while now but I recently said this is enough! So here is a date picker that will do exactly what I want and anyone else that wants the same thing can use it if they need to.</p>

				<h1>Additional Info</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>Included is a css file with basic styling that can be tweeked to your hearts content. Seemed important to mention that since I have no idea how to make things look good.</p>
				<p>Ctrl-clicking on the shortcuts (if they add dates) will add to your current selection Shift-clicking on the Today and Yestarday shortcuts will select a range from the last clicked date.</p>
